    Java provides three classes to represent a sequence of characters: <b>String, StringBuffer </b>, and
    <b>StringBuilder</b>. The String class is an immutable class whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are
    mutable. There are many differences between StringBuffer and StringBuilder. The StringBuilder class is
    introduced since JDK (Java Development Kit) 1.5. <br> <br>

    <b>String</b> is basically an object that represents sequence of char values. String works the same as n array of
    characters. For example: <br> <br>

    &emsp char[] ch = {&#39;j&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;v&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;t&#39;,&#39;p&#39;,&#39;o&#39;,&#39;i&#39;,&#39;n&#39;,&#39;t&#39;}; <br>
    &emsp String s = new String(ch); <br>

    Is the same as:<br>

    &emsp String s = &quot;javatpoint&quot;; <br> <br>

    <b>String</b> class provides a lot of methods to perform operations on string such as compare(), concat(),
    equals(), split(), length(), replace(), compareTo(), intern(), substring() etc. <br>
    The java.lang.String class implements Serializable, Comparable and CharSequence interfaces. <br>

    <string name="midtermthree"><![CDATA[Two different ways to create an array. <br>
    1. <b>Array</b>: Simple fixed sized arrays that we create in Java <br>
    &emsp int arr [] = new int [10] <br> <br>

    2. <b>ArrayList</b> : Dynamic sized arrays in Java that implement List interface. <br>
    &emsp ArrayList&lt;Type&gt; arrL = new ArrayList &lt;Type&gt; (); <br>
    &emsp Here Type is the type of elements in ArrayList to be created <br> <br>


    <b>Differences between Array and ArrayList</b> <br>
    <p>•An array is a basic functionality provided by Java. ArrayList is part of collection
    framework in Java. Array members are accessed using [], while ArrayList has a set of
    methods to access elements and modify them.</p><br> <br>

    <p>•Array is a fixed size data structure while ArrayList is not. One need not to mention the size
    of Arraylist while creating its object. Even if we specify some initial capacity, we can add
    more elements.</p><br> <br>

    <p>•Array can contain both primitive data types as well as objects of a class depending on the
    definition of the array. However, ArrayList only supports object entries, not the primitive
    data types.</p><br> <br>

    <p>•ArrayList can’t be created for primitive data types, members of ArrayList are always
    references to objects at different memory locations. In ArrayList, the actual objects are
    never stored at contiguous locations. References of the actual objects are stored at
    contiguous locations. In array, it depends whether the arrays is of primitive type or object
    type. In case of primitive types, actual values are contiguous locations, but in case of
    objects, allocation is similar to ArrayList.</p><br> <br>

    <string name="midtermthree2DandMDArray"><![CDATA[<p>Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements. It inherits AbstractList class
    and implements List interface. </p> <br>

    The important points about Java ArrayList class are: <br>
    • Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements. <br>
    • Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order. <br.
    • Java ArrayList class is non synchronized. <br>
    • Java ArrayList allows random access because array works at the index basis. <br>
    • In Java ArrayList class, manipulation is slow because a lot of shifting needs to occur
    if any element is removed from the array list. <br>

    <string name="MidtermFourInterface"><![CDATA[
    <b>Interface</b> <br>
    • An interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants,
    method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Method bodies
    exist only for default methods and static methods. <br>
    • It should be noted that interfaces cannot be instantiated as they can only
    be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces. This is the basic difference
    between interfaces and classes. Also note that the method signatures in an interface
    have no braces and are terminated with a semicolon, which is not the case in a class
    method definition. <br.
    • Interfaces are used for abstraction. Since methods in interfaces does not have body,
    they have to be implemented by the class before you can access them. The class that
    implements interface must implement all the methods of that interface. <br>

    <string name="MidtermFourInheritancee"><![CDATA[
    <b>Inheritance</b> <br>
    • Inheritance is the process wherein characteristics are inherited from ancestors.
    Inheritance in java can be defined as a mechanism where a new class is derived from an
    existing class. It is possible for classes to inherit or acquire the properties and methods
    of other classes, just like a son can acquire some traits and behaviour from his father. <br>
    • The inheritance mechanism is very useful in code reuse. Classes can be derived from
    classes that are derived from classes that are derived from classes, and so on. In java, by
    default, the Object class is the parent class. <br.
    • Inheritance is declared using the extends keyword. You declare that one
    class extends another class by using the extends keyword in the class definition. <br>
    • For example, mammals is a super-class while human beings and animals are
    subclasses. Animals inherit all of the mammals’ properties. Subsequently, dogs can
    inherit all animals’ properties making it a subclass of the animals. <br>

    ]]></string>

    <string name="MidtermFourMethodOverriding"><![CDATA[
    • Declaring a method in sub class which is already present in parent class is known as
    method overriding. Overriding is done so that a child class can give its own
    implementation to a method which is already provided by the parent class. In this case
    the method in parent class is called overridden method and the method in child class is
    called overriding method. <br>
    • In Java, a child class has the same method as of base class. In such cases child class
    overrides the parent class method without even touching the source code of the base
    class. <br>

    ]]></string>

    <string name="MidtermFourSuperclassMethod"><![CDATA[
    • In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We
    group the &quot;inheritance concept&quot; into two categories: <br>
    &emsp • subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
    &emsp • superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from
    &emsp&emsp • To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.

    <string name="FinalOneInputOutputStream"><![CDATA[
    • Streams are used to handle input/output operations. <br>
    • Stream is like a pipe which carries data from one end to the other. The end points are
    nothing but the source and destination of the data to be read/written. <br> <br>

    Streams are classified into two types, which are the parent class of all the subclasses of other
    streams. <br> <br>

    • <b>InputStream</b> – Superclass of all classes used to read the input. <br>
    • <b>OutputStream</b> – Superclass of all classes used to write the output. <br>

    <b>There are 3 fields in System class which represents some stream.</b>
    1. in – Represents the standard input device <br>
    2. out – Represents the standard output device <br>
    3. err – same as System.out (Errors are displayed using this field.) <br>
    <br>

    •  System.in field represents the InputStream object. Both System.out and System.err fields
    represents the PrintStream object.
    •  To accept the data from the input device, we need to connect the System.in (representing the
    basic input device) to an input stream. <br>

        <<b>BYTESTREAMS:</b>
    • Byte streams are used to read/write input/output of 8 bit bytes.All kind of data
    (text,image,audio,video) can be read/written using byte streams. <br>
